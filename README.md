# Machine-Learning
All the important and general machine learning algorithm implimentation<br/>
1) Recomendation systeam:
Recomendation system has well known applications.I have used collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.<br/>
2) Anomaly detection:
It is used to find some unusal activity.I have implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.<br/>
3) Linear regression:
It is an important algorithm for prediction of continuous values based on data. I have implemented the algorithm with one varible for food truck profit and with multivariable for housing prices.<br/>
4) Logistic regreesion:
It is classifiction algorithm where we plot a line and make distiction among classes.The problem I have choosen is if the student will get the admission in university or not.<br/>
5) regularized logistic regression:
I have implemented regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance.(In folder of Logistic reg.)<br/>
6) Muti-class classification:
I have used logistic regression , neural networks to recognize handwritten digits between 0 to 9.<br/>
7) Neural Network:
This code contains the backpropogation step to train the neural network.<br/>
8) Support Vector machine:
I have used SVM for spam  classification of the mails.<br/>
9) K-means:
K-means is one of the basic custring algorithm.I have used it for the image compression which is an interesting used case.<br/>
10) PCA:
Priciple componet analysis is the dimensionality reduction algorithm and is very important for the removing unimportant data which is not going to affect the results by huge amount.<br/>
